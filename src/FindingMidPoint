I've seen programmers use the formula

mid = start + (end - start) / 2
instead of using the simpler formula

mid = (start + end) / 2
for finding the middle element in the array or list.
Why do they use the former one?
/*******************************************
Sol: mid = start + (end - start) / 2 won't overflow
if start and end are large positive numbers. With signed operands, overflow is undefined
(Note that end - start may overflow, but only if start < 0 or end < 0.)
